Flagship Gallery uses visual content in print and digital media...
The gallery hosts recurring monthly events, for which I have developed digital and physical content; published on the gallery's website, social media accounts, as well as on printed posters and flyers.

Cooperation with the Flagship Gallery marketing team brings opportunities to use works with the liberty of referenced meanings and associations. It's a kind of message-guessing game invitation.

> It seems, nowadays, visual language is meaningless, devoid of sense and message. Or the message is shifted into a vague area of unbridled interpretation.

### Stereoscopic works created for Flagship Gallery shows

_like a bird_

Bird sketches compiled in the stereoscopic composition, using depth maps created in Maya and applied in Nuke as a stereo-image editing tool.

_First autumn in Hamilton_

Leaves accumulated on the lawn. The pattern used for testing the method of creating "cross-eye" stereoscopic image.

* Depth map is created using the 3D character models;
* Depth map is used for distortion to test both, cross-eye stereoscopic and an anaglyph image;

I would be inclined to call it an anamorphic composition.
