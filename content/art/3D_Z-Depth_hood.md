> I was quite surprised to learn 3D video editing methods by converting source footage using depth maps. But in fact, it became obvious that this method is effective and, above all, gives great control over the editing process as perfecting the visual storytelling.

3D image may be achieved by parallax displaced photography or rendering. Though in 3D editing much more efficient is the usage of the Z-Depth as a stereoscopic (or spatial) displacement reference.

Conversion requiers a depth map or actually depth maps, if for high quality imagery with various optical phenomena.

The depth maps can be done on a basis of Alphas cutting out the objects on a "depth layers" of the image.
Brighter value for the front layers.
Another way, more accurate, less guesswork, the method requires a 3D model, adjusted to the perspective of the image by using of the camera projection.

I am not working with depth maps created by phone's lenses.
