My painting is usually executed in oil or acrylic, and painting sketches in watercolor or temper (acrylic temper). As my biggest interest is in visual perception, I lean towards impressionist, post-impressionist, but generally, realistic art, though I am very inspired by the subjective, individualistic, and expressionistic approach.

For experimental purposes, I am leaning towards minimalist and optical-art solutions that generally include digital tools or even depend on a computer graphic.

My understanding of the minimalistic approach is based on dominant of finding necessary minimal features for solving or recording an inspiring, observed, analyzed phenomena.

The works presented here are observational studies. They are not intended to capture "everything" within the assumed aesthetics, on the contrary, they are an attempt to capture only certain leading impressions, without or generally disregarding possible assignments to the existing "aesthetics".

For me, realism is a capture of even a fraction of the phenomenon that inspires us to work on a painting.

The dominant accent was the rhythm of the trunks against the background of illuminated snow and the delicate pattern of gray lace of tiny twigs.
