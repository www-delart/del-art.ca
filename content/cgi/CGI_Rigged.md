Rigging is a creation of a skeletal structure for a model to allow control and manipulation for animation.

Above are samples of simple riggings. The Fish has deformers used as controllers for mimicking simple organic movements of ventral and dorsal fins, as well as the smooth undulating movements of the torso.

The model of the box as a rigging employs just parenting and grouping technique and the rotation pivots of the elements placed in the hinges of the model. For the rigid body, this technique is enough to create the visualization of moving parts.

Rigging a quadruped animal is relatively advanced. Spine, neck, elephant trunk are elements that require flexibility but no extensibility, at least when it is not cartoony character.

All four limbs are rigged with the Inverse Kinematic handles.

Lego Man is basically a rigid model, but it still has some cartoony freedom of deformations, so some limited flexibility of the torso and arms is enabled by the skeleton setup.

The Girl character is most advanced, in the arms are used two setups, Inverse Kinematic and Forward Kinematic. The head has full facial animation rigs with blend shapes technique.
