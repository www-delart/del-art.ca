A project iniciated by referencing to sketch drawing, depicting crucified Christ.

After research and the lack of sources of good quality and high resolution, I have recreated the drawing.
Also the 3D model for depth was created.

> Depth is controlled by one z-depth map, what is creating bendings at edges of layers. but generally, the tested method works nicely.

On the published materials, posters and flyers, and on prepared CD covers and lebels, the stereoscopic anaglyph images are used.
