The main task is to adjust the layout of the ad's elements to the variable surfaces offered in a given journal.

> In addition to the high standard of graphic compositions, flawless technical performance is a feature of these materials, which must bring a guaranteed outcome, regardless of the actual technical advancement of the publishing houses, with no supervising contact made except for the transfer of files and proofs.
