The brochure created from scratch for the developer company starting a big renovation project in unique circumstances of the bylaws on the protection of architectural monuments. The dilapidated historic tenement house was completely reconstructed. It is safe to say only the front wall was in conditions allowing the preservation of the original structure.

Nevertheless, the bylaws restrict the use of heavy machinery and every piece of the genuine building had to be preserved and indicated in the establishment finally handed over to the public.

My job besides graphic design was also to create a way of selling the idea to future buyers. The narrative content writing, the idea of showing the project, was fully developed in my studio.

The message is clear, well divided, and nicely illustrated.

This was a time when 3D architectural models were out of my reach, but I have created the spatial rendering of the floor plans, boosting an understanding of the proposal.

The brochure presents the comprehensive offer, split up into topics bringing all aspects of the proposed opportunities.

The material is categorized and labeled on the right margin, providing all necessary information for the prospective investors. There is a basic outline, the highlight of prominent features, the detailed floor plans and state of art solutions included in the project, and the prices range and options. The brochure is illustrated with architectural visualizations, floor plans, and images of artifacts and Krakow architecture.
