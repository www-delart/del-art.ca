Projects created and supervised for Astellas covered many areas of marketing, from the current preparation and technical supervision of infomercial publications to long-term advertising campaigns developed for periods of years. I was lucky to participate in projects following the merger of Yamanouchi and Fujisawa pharmaceutical companies that created Astellas.

Astellas was a new brand, but in the same time with a huge background, the company had a full portfolio of branding and marketing materials, yet transferring international advertising campaigns to local market required creativity and new ideas.

* Technical part of the job was to adapt current branding materials, secure and supervising quality of rendered marketing tools;
* Features of the local market required the development of new visuals used for new strategies and campaigns.

The example of adapting the general line of a promotional campaign was the creation of a leading character and dominant theme for visuals.
